## removeXLogo

this is a simple addon designed to help replace the new annoying boring icon 
with the old one from hosted via wikipedia.

⚠️may work on chrome, haven't tested. use whatever steps you need to do so their.

⚠️only works for desktop as of now!⚠️

## issue uploading to mozilla addon repo's, working on a resolution but heres the fix for now:

1.download this addon (put where ever you like, it doesn't matter)
1.goto: (about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox)[about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox]. this is firefox's dev console for dev things
1.expand "Temporary Extentions" which is at the top of the page
1.select "Load Temporary Addon"
1.navigate to the unzipped addon and select any file then select "open". firefox claims you can use any file, but to have time i would recommend clicking on "manifest.json"
1.you should be done! glhf and have fun doomscrolling
