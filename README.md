# removeXLogo

this is a simple addon designed to help replace the new annoying boring icon 
with the old one from hosted via wikipedia.

⚠️may work on chrome, haven't tested. use whatever steps you need to do so their.

⚠️only works for desktop as of now!⚠️

## issue uploading to mozilla addon repo's, working on a resolution but heres the fix for now:
*download this addon (put where ever you like, it doesn't matter)
*goto: (about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox)[about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox]. this is firefox's dev console for dev things
*expand "Temporary Extentions" which is at the top of the page
*select "Load Temporary Addon"
*navigate to the unzipped addon and select any file then select "open". firefox claims you can use any file, but to have time i would recommend clicking on "manifest.json"
*you should be done! glhf and have fun doomscrolling
